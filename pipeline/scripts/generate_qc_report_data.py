Before performing quality control, genotypes were harmonized with a modern reference panel. Using Genotype Harmonizer, variant strand was aligned with 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data. In the process of alignment, variant IDs were replaced with 1000 Genomes variant IDs. Additonally, many ambiguous variants (A/T and G/C variants) were properly aligned based on nearby LD scores. Any ambiguous variants that could not be aligned using LD were removed. Variants that did not match with any 1000 Genomes variant were maintained in this step. After harmonizing with Genotype Harmonizer, variants that did not match any 1000 Genomes variants were aligned manually with the human reference build GRCh37, flagging variants with non-reference allele for removal.""".format(nSamples, nArrays)]
